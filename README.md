Basic build instructions
------------------------

(for more detailed instructions, see [the development page][ppsspp-devel])

First of all, after having checked out the source, don't forget to
run:

    git submodule update --init
 
in order to get the "native" library.

Now, the actual building:

PPSSPP currently uses CMake for its build system. In order
to build for most systems, create a `build` directory and
run:

    cmake path/to/ppsspp
    make

Alternatively, run b.sh which will create the directory for you.

You can specify the -G parameter to cmake to choose a generator.
The `NMake Makefiles`, `Visual Studio 11` (projects + sln),
`GNU Makefiles` and `Unix Makefiles` generators have been tested.

Of course in-tree builds are supported, but that makes cleanup
harder to do; with out-of-tree builds you can just remove the
`build` directory.

Note: There is also a Qt frontend available. Simply open
PPSSPPQt.pro in [Qt Creator 2.6+][qt-creator] and press run. The
Qt frontend currently supports Windows, Linux, Blackberry 10,
Symbian and Meego.

Building for Linux/BSD/etc
--------------------------

Install the libsdl1.2 (SDL 1.2) development headers. This is called
`libsdl1.2-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `SDL-devel` on Fedora/RHEL,
`sdl12` on BSD ports.

Currently the user interface is identical to Android's, operated
with the mouse.

Alternatively, a Qt-based frontend is available in the Qt/ dir.

Building for OSX
----------------

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools and, using macports, fink or
homebrew, install the SDL development headers. This is called `sdl`
on homebrew. Just follow the basic build instructions afterwards.

Currently the user interface is identical to Android's, operated
with the mouse. A Qt-based interface is planned.

Building for Android
--------------------

To build for android, first you must set the ANDROID\_NDK environment
variable to point to the path of your NDK install. This is done on
windows cmd with `set ANDROID_NDK=X:\...`, on bourne shells with
`export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/ndk`, and on C shells with
`setenv ANDROID_NDK /path/to/ndk`.

Create a `build-android` directory and inside it run:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/ppsspp/android/android.toolchain.cmake path/to/ppsspp
    make

After `make` finishes, it will have created the needed .so files in
path/to/ppsspp/android/libs/armeabi-v7a. You can now use the build.xml
in the android/ dir to build the final executable, or import the android/
folder as an existing project in Eclipse.

Note that Eclipse won't notice if you have made changes to the C++ code.
Introduce a meaningless change to a random .java file such as a whitespace
to get Eclipse to rebuild the project.

Also note that the `Visual Studio` generators aren't compatible with compilers
other than Microsoft's, but `NMake Makefiles` works fine.

Building for Blackberry
-----------------------

To build for Blackberry, you must first have the [latest Native SDK][blackberry-ndk] installed.

To set up your environment for cross-compiling you must then use:
    source ~/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh

Finally, you are ready to compile. Go to ppsspp/Blackberry/ and run:
    ./build.sh

If you are on Windows, you will need GNU and CMake to run the bash script.

Alternatively, you can use the Qt frontend by compiling the PPSSPPQt.pro in
the Qt/ directory with `qmake` from the NDK or [QtCreator 2.6+][qt-creator].

Building for Symbian
--------------------

To build for Symbian, you require:

1) [GCC 4.6.3][symbian-gcc] from Mentor Graphics.

2) Symbian Qt libraries. You can find these in the final Nokia Qt SDK or online.

3) Set up your SDK to use Symbian GCCE 4.6.3. See a tutorial here: http://www.summeli.fi/?p=4220

Then simply compile the PPSSPPQt.pro with `qmake` from the SDK or [QtCreator 2.6+][qt-creator].
