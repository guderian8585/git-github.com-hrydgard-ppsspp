Basic build instructions
------------------------

(for more detailed instructions, see [the development page][ppsspp-devel])

First of all, after having checked out the source, don't forget to
run:

    git submodule update --init
 
in order to get the "native" library.

Now, the actual building:

PPSSPP currently uses CMake for its build system. In order
to build for most systems, create a `build` directory and
run:

    cmake path/to/ppsspp
    make

You can specify the -G parameter to cmake to choose a generator.
The `NMake Makefiles`, `Visual Studio 11` (projects + sln),
`GNU Makefiles` and `Unix Makefiles` generators have been tested.

Of course in-tree builds are supported, but that makes cleanup
harder to do; with out-of-tree builds you can just remove the
`build` directory.

Building for Linux/BSD/etc
--------------------------

Install the libsdl1.2 (SDL 1.2) development headers. This is called
`libsdl1.2-devel` on Debian/Ubuntu, `SDL-devel` on Fedora/RHEL,
`sdl12` on BSD ports.

Currently the user interface is identical to Android's, operated
with the mouse. A Qt-based interface is planned.

Building for OSX
----------------

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools and, using macports, fink or
homebrew, install the SDL development headers. This is called `sdl`
on homebrew. Just follow the basic build instructions afterwards.

Currently the user interface is identical to Android's, operated
with the mouse. A Qt-based interface is planned.

Building for Android
--------------------

To build for android, first you must set the ANDROID\_NDK environment
variable to point to the path of your NDK install. This is done on
windows cmd with `set ANDROID_NDK=X:\...`, on bourne shells with
`export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/ndk`, and on C shells with
`setenv ANDROID_NDK /path/to/ndk`.

Create a `build-android` directory and inside it run:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/ppsspp/android/android.toolchain.cmake path/to/ppsspp
    make

After `make` finishes, it will have created the needed .so files in
path/to/ppsspp/android/libs/armeabi-v7a. You can now use the build.xml
in the android/ dir to build the final executable, or import the android/
folder as an existing project in Eclipse.

Note that Eclipse won't notice if you have made changes to the C++ code.
Introduce a meaningless change to a random .java file such as a whitespace
to get Eclipse to rebuild the project.

Also note that the `Visual Studio` generators aren't compatible with compilers
other than microsoft's, but `NMake Makefiles` works fine.

Building for Blackberry
-----------------------

To build for Blackberry, you must first have the latest Native SDK installed from developer.blackberry.com/native and have compiled the SDL port available from github.com/blackberry/SDL to your NDK workspace. Then checkout the latest version of PPSSPP to your NDK workspace.

To set up your environment for cross-compiling you must then use:
    source ~/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh

Finally, you are ready to compile. Change directory to ppsspp/SDL and run:
    ./blackberry_build.sh

If you are on Windows, you will need GNU tools and CMake to run the bash script.

Currently SDL is required for sound output. EGL is used for the GLES2 interface, which is identical to the Android one. There are plans to move to a Qt interface and a different sound library (such as asound) in future.
