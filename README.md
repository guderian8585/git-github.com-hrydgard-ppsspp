PPSSPP - a fast and portable PSP emulator
=========================================

Created by Henrik Rydgård

Additional code by many contributors, see the Credits screen

Originally released under the GPL 2.0 (and later) in November 2012

No BIOS file required to play, PPSSPP is in many ways a "HLE" emulator.

What's new in 1.2.2
-------------------
* Went back to the old way of initializing graphics on Android. Should fix many recent issues.
* Some graphical fixes, a vertex cache performance improvement and a screen clear optimization
* Fix for dual source blending on most SHIELD devices, causing graphical issues.
* Fix the homebrew store incorrectly unzipping some games. This will lead to more games being added.
* Slightly faster ISO handling

What's new in 1.2.1
-------------------
* Fixes for some crash-on-shutdown and app switching problems.

What's new in 1.2.0
-------------------
* A major rework of sceAtrac audio decoding, fixing various music hangs and similar issues
* Many fixes and workarounds to depth and stencil buffer usage, and also FBO management
* Audio reverb support
* Combo keys - custom touch buttons that press multiple PSP buttons
* 5xBR upscaling on GPU (postprocessing effect)
* Fix problems with playback of video with mono audio
* Performance improvements like multithreaded audio mixing
* ARM64 JIT crash bug fixes
* GLSL shader cache to reduce stuttering ingame
* Support render-to-CLUT functionality that some games use to change colors of various monsters
* x86-64 support on Android
* Auto-hide on-screen controls after a while of no usage
* Fixes to prescale UV speedhack, now seems reliable
* Faster ISO RAM cache
* New UI for moving around the PSP display on larger screens
* Minor UI fixes like better slider controls
* Assorted stability fixes (ffmpeg crash, etc)
* Volume setting is back
* Preparations for supporting more graphics APIs
* AdHoc port offset
* Support another HD remaster (Sora no Kiseki Kai HD)

What's new in 1.1.1
-------------------
* Fixed new crash in Persona and other games on ARM64, like Galaxy S6
* Fixed crashes when trying to launch web browser when not present on Android, like on Android TV
* Fix crash in games that used "depal" functionality (OpenGL)
* Fixed rounding mode problems in the JITs
* Fix crash when loading savestates many times, and savestate compatibility on Android-x86
* Fix minor glitch in Ridge Racer

What's new in 1.1
-----------------
* Support for ARM64 on Android, for improved performance on new devices. Has some new optimizations.
* Support Android TV, like nVidia Shield TV
* Screen rotation on PC, useful for vertical games like Star Soldier
* Many minor performance improvements and compatibility bug fixes
* GPU emulation fixes like correct depth rounding, fixing text in Phantasy Star
* Other graphical fixes like UV rotation
* Support savestates for homebrew apps
* Simple integrated "Homebrew Store" to download PSP homebrew apps
* Minor AdHoc multiplayer improvements. Still many issues left.
* Disable a dangerous optimization on ARM, causing walk-through-walls in Tenchu
* sceAtrac music compatibility fixes, fixing noise in a few games
* Better texture scaling performance
* Direct3D closer in features to OpenGL
* Works better on BSD operating systems
* Savedata management UI

What's new in 1.0.1
-------------------
* Bugfixes like the save state scroll issue, cosmetic issues like overscroll
* Some cheat code bugfixes
* Adler32 and Mersenne Twister modules added (fixes some obscure games)
* Fix for Jak & Daxter slowdown
* Graphics hack for Phantasy Star Portable 2 for Direct3D9
* Fix compatibility with some PowerVR devices broken since v0.9.5-959-g4998044

What's new in 1.0
-----------------
* Many, many bug fixes in JIT and elsewhere, improving compatibility
* Proper fix for Zenfone and related devices
* Direct3D 9 supported as a rendering backend on Windows, helps on old GPUs and can be faster than OpenGL in many cases
* You can now create specific configs per game
* FPU rounding modes much better supported, fixes the Peace Walker boss that was undefeatable. NOTE: This breaks saves in Gods Eater - you must turn off the better rounding, load your save game, turn it on and save.
* The JIT now uses SSE on x86, improving speed considerably. This does not affect ARM devices, that's for the next version or two.
* Improved audio output code on both Windows and Android, reducing audio latency on Windows and on some Android systems
* FFMPEG upgraded, fixed some music hangs ("GHA phase shifts")
* Some Ad Hoc improvements, coldbird.net is now default adhoc server. Ad Hoc still unfinished and hard to use.
* Graphics fixes: Bezier/spline drawing fixes, vertex position fixes, DanganRonpa on Adreno fixed, flat shading fixed, vertex cache improved, some PowerVR blockiness issues fixed, screen scaling filter added, Google Cardboard support
* Simulate UMD speed better, fixing hangs in several games
* More Atrac3 fixes, fixing hangs
* Somewhat better disk full handling
* Fixes to dynamic unloading of code, fixing problems in GEB and TRM 2/3
* Updated to SDL2 where applicable (Linux, Mac)
* Some new features, like analog/dpad-swap hotkey, graphics hack for Phantasy Star, show last bit of debug log in dev tools, etc



ADHOC SUPPORT (by Igor Calabria)
================================
This is based on coldbird's code: http://code.google.com/p/aemu/
All credit goes to him!

Status
------
Code is a bit of a mess and it's not fully functional yet, I still need to implement
some functions and add a upnp lib(really important for people with routers).

I did test it with some games(emulator <-> real psp with the server running locally)
and it's looking good:

* Worms Open Warfare: Ran just fine, I was able to play a whole match without problems
* Monster Hunter Freedom Unite: Runs fine too. Gathering Hall and embarking on quests works
* Dissidia Duodecim 012: Doesn't work. It requires some functions that I haven't implemented
yet. Also, it uses a port < 1000 and thats reserved for admin apps on linux, running the emu
as sudo "solves" it, but it's far from ideal.
* Pacman World Rally: Works too.

Update (Kyhel) :
---------------
* Now compiles on both Mac OSX and Windows. For more details on how to play and build
go to see there http://forums.ppsspp.org/showthread.php?tid=3595&pid=59241#pid59241
* Got it tested windows <-> mac osx <-> psp, it works
* Monster Hunter 3rd HD works too, as well as God Eater Burst.
