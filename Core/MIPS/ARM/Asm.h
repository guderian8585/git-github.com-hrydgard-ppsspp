// In PPSSPP, we don't use inline assembly. Instead, we generate all machine-near
// code at runtime. In the case of fixed code like this, after writing it, we write
// protect the memory, essentially making it work just like precompiled code.

// There are some advantages to this approach:
//	 1) No need to setup an external assembler in the build.
//	 2) Cross platform, as long as it's x86/x64.
//	 3) Can optimize code at runtime for the specific CPU model.
// There aren't really any disadvantages other than having to maintain code emitters,
// which we have to do anyway :)
// 
// To add a new asm routine, just add another const here, and add the code to Generate.
// Also, possibly increase the size of the code buffer.
